# one-template-theme
An experimental WordPress Theme that works with just one PHP template.

With this theme you need to build all your HTML structure with editor (Gutenberg) blocks. It is kind of a guerilla version of the upcoming full site editing concept -- just with standard themes (and not the 'new kid on the block' themes -- pun intended). For me that works beautifully. But yet it is entirely experimental, so please handle with care.
